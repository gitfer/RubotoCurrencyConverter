RubotoCurrencyConverter is just a ruboto script for currency conversion.
At the moment it works only for euro -> croatian kunas conversion and viceversa.
It has the current (2012-06-23) conversion value as a default but you can change currency values with the ad-hoc buttons.
At the current state it's just a proof of concept but it works flawlessly.
Heavily based on demo-ruboto.rb file.
